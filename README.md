# Data-Cleaning-and-Wrangling-for-Two-Toronto-Sports-Teams
Cleaning and wrangling sports data

The following repository cleans and wrangles data from the Toronto Argonauts and the Toronto Maple Leafs from the
following Wikipedia articles, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Toronto_Argonauts_seasons) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Toronto_Maple_Leafs_seasons), to calculate and graphically display the 
winning percentages of both teams. In calculating winning percentages, we follow this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage)
and in particular, count ties and over-time losses as half-points.

This repository is primarily aimed at cleanly presenting the data rather than conducting an analysis. To that end, the visualization
in this repository of the Win % produced from both of these teams exhibits short and long-term changes that may be present (by displaying
line graphs) and cancellations that have occured over the century (by displaying gaps in these line graphs).
